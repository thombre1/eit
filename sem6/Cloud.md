## Unit 4
#### 1.What are risk in cloud computing
**Ans:** Risks are as follows:
	1. ROI mismatch (short term v/s long term results may differ).
	2. Cultural Mismatch (Bank want robust and uniform infra, cloud has approach of being bleeding edge). 
	3. A new vulnerability may be introduced (unprobeable).
	4. Migration might cause irrecoverable catastrophe.
	5. Throughput mismatch (What we expected the cloud to handle might not be able to handle compared to the cost of what we are paying the cloud provider)
	6. Skill mismatch ( It is not expected to have a full proof Service oriented architecture for cloud but it is still expected to know the amount required for operating services on cloud)
	7. SLA mismatch (can have legal, compliance or business issues thus reliability issues on the provider).
#### 2.What is Risk Management in Cloud computing.
**Ans:** Risk management is the process of reducing as much risk as possible in the functioning of an infrastructure while also having a budget for risks that occur in runtime.
- The goal is not to get maximum insurance for the occurring issues but to minimize the issues and the cost of the alternative remedies themselves.
- The causes can be: Hazards or Internal Procedures
- The investors pay for keeping the infra functioning as much as possible as a vision for RAP(Risk Administration Program).
#### 3.Explain the process of Risk Management
**Ans:** Risk Management has 6 Step Process:
	1. Identify Objective or risk admin program. (Keep the org functioning and maximum safety of the workers' career)
	2. Identify the risks (use questionnaire, surveys, financial reports, insurance data)
	3. Evaluate the risk(label them critical, significant and insignificant based of their impact on income, cost and time)
	4. Consider the risk remedies and what alternatives should be applied for what risk
	5. Risk Financing, analyze what have the risks have caused to manifest in terms of cost and function throughput. What assets were used up in the process
	6. Evaluate and review, as risks keep occurring and old ones get irrelevant due to technological advancements, its absolutely necessary to evaluate the infra SOA so that it does not contain any redundancy.

#### 4.Explain the Cloud Security Services
**Ans:** Cloud Security Services are categorized under 3 goals:
##### 1) Confidentiality
Data access to only the authorized users. Focus on authentication through:
- Access Control (for info and resources)
- Passwords and Biometrics
- Encryption
- Privacy and Ethics (through rules and regulations)
##### 2) Integrity 
Maintaining and safeguarding the correctness and completeness of data.
Integrity can be reduced due to hazards, internal procedures and malware.
Can be increased through maintaining confidentiality, regular backups and Data Loss Protection

##### 3) Availability
The state of readiness of data to be accessed by the respective authorized users whenever requested.
Data backup plans 
Disaster Recovery Plan
#### 5.Explain Data  security and Application security Maintained in  cloud computing.
**Ans:**
 **Data Security**:(CIA)
- Encryption, authentication, and access controls.
- Regular security audits.

**Application Security**:
- Secure coding practices.
- Regular patching and updates.
- API security and firewalls.
#### 6.What are the  secure cloud software requirements
**Ans:** Should have (data + app security features)
All CIA(Authentication, Authorization, Passwords, Biometrics, Encryption, entails Privacy and Ethics)
All App(Secure API and Firewall)

#### 7.Explain the different key security Challenges for cloud computing.
**Ans:**
1. INVESTIGATION(not viable due to decentralized nature)
2. Data Segregation(Customers data stored with other customer data. Customers data might not be encrypted due to damage due to faulty encryption)
3. Long term Viability(Provides check for Confidentiality in case of mergers or acquisition; Customers check for integrity)
4. Compromised Servers(then availability issue of data or service)
5. Regulatory Issue(Rules of Land if change)
6. Recovery
